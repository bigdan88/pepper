Pepper is an AI assistant developed by Daniel Han that is designed to answer questions about him. It is a svelte app that uses a combination of semantic search and prompt engineering to provide accurate and relevant information.

Pepper's main function is to summarize Daniel's knowledge, skills, and experience in a concise and user-friendly way. To do this, the app performs semantic search on a knowledge corpus to identify the most relevant information about Daniel. This allows Pepper to quickly and efficiently provide accurate and useful information to users.

Once the relevant information has been identified, Pepper uses prompt engineering to generate natural language responses to user queries. This process involves analyzing the user's question and generating a response that is clear, concise, and informative. The responses are designed to be easily understood by users with varying levels of technical knowledge.

Pepper's predecessor, Benji, performed a similar function but interacted with the GPT-3 language model directly. However, Pepper uses a more streamlined approach that combines semantic search and prompt engineering to provide a faster and more accurate user experience.

Pepper is hosted on Vercel, which provides a fast and reliable hosting solution for the app. The app is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, with a clean and intuitive interface.

One interesting aspect of Pepper is that it is named after Daniel's dog, a mini goldendoodle. This personal touch adds a unique and friendly element to the app, making it feel more approachable and relatable to users.

Overall, Pepper is an impressive AI assistant that demonstrates Daniel's expertise in natural language processing and AI technology. It provides a valuable service by summarizing Daniel's knowledge and experience in a way that is accessible and useful to a wide range of users.
